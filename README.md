# KOTOR GIT Data Output for Max
This is a simple script that will derive the relevant data from an object (or objects) in 3DS Max/GMax needed to be added to a KOTOR GIT when creating new static camera, placeable, or creature entries and output it to the Listener window. 

Instructions
============
Download the script and put it in your Scripts folder, or some other convenient location. In Max, select the object/s of interest, hit F11 to open the Listener window, then hit CTRL+R or go to File -> Run Script and select KOTOR_GIT_Data_Output_for_Max.ms and hit enter. You should get an output something like the following:
```
===================================================
Object data formatted for KOTOR GIT injection
--------------------- GENERIC ---------------------
SELECTED OBJECT: PMBIM
POSITION (in metres): 106.526, 33.619, 4.21
ROTATION (in degrees): 0.0, 0.0, 112.5
------------------ STATIC CAMERA ------------------
PITCH (X rotation in degrees): 0.0
ORIENTATION (Z rotation as a WXYZ quaternion):
0.55557, 0.0, 0.0, 0.83147
-------------------- PLACEABLE --------------------
BEARING (Z rotation in radians): 1.9635
------------------- SCRIPTING * -------------------
FACING: (Z rotation + 90°): 202.5
-------------------- CREATURE * -------------------
X ORIENTATION ( COS(Z + 90°) ): -0.92388
Y ORIENTATION ( SIN(Z + 90°) ): -0.382683
---------------------- NOTES ----------------------
Warning: Sections marked * assume that the module
uses East as 0°. For a handful of modules this will
result in incorrect values. See readme for details.
